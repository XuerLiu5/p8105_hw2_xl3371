## Problem 1

### First, clean the data in pols-month.csv

``` r
pols_month_clean = read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         day = as.integer(day)) %>%
  mutate(month = case_match(
    month, 
    "01" ~ "Jan",
    "02" ~ "Feb",
    "03" ~ "Mar",
    "04" ~ "Apr",
    "05" ~ "May",
    "06" ~ "Jun",
    "07" ~ "Jul",
    "08" ~ "Aug",
    "09" ~ "Sep",
    "10" ~ "Oct",
    "11" ~ "Nov",
    "12" ~ "Dec"
  )) %>%
  mutate(
    president = ifelse(prez_dem==1, "dem", "gop")) %>%
  select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day))
```

### Second, clean the data in snp.csv

``` r
snp_clean = read.csv("./data/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         year = ifelse(year > 2049, year - 100, year),
    month = case_match(month, 
    "01" ~ "Jan",
    "02" ~ "Feb",
    "03" ~ "Mar",
    "04" ~ "Apr",
    "05" ~ "May",
    "06" ~ "Jun",
    "07" ~ "Jul",
    "08" ~ "Aug",
    "09" ~ "Sep",
    "10" ~ "Oct",
    "11" ~ "Nov",
    "12" ~ "Dec"
  )) %>%
  select(year, month, close) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  relocate(year, month)
```

### Third, tidy the unemployment data

``` r
unemployment_clean = read.csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "umemployment_rate"
  ) %>%
  rename(year = Year) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))
```

### Merge three datasets into result

``` r
pols_snp = left_join(pols_month_clean, snp_clean, by = c("year","month"))
result = left_join(pols_snp, unemployment_clean, by = c("year","month"))
```

### Description

1.  The `pols_month_clean` dataset contains 9 variables and 822
    observations. The key variables include year, month, and president
    (elected president’s party). This dataset tells us about the party
    affiliation distribution (democrat or republican) for governors and
    senators from years 1947 to 2015.
2.  The `snp_clean` dataset contains 3 variables and 787 observations,
    ranging from 1950 to 2015. The key variables include year, month,
    and close (closing values of stock index).
3.  The `unemployment_clean` dataset contains 3 variables and 816
    observations, ranging from 1948 to 2015. The key variables include
    year, month, and unemployment rate.
4.  The `result` dataset merges the above three datasets, with 11
    columns and 822 rows. The data ranges from 1947 to 2015, indicating
    the potential correlation between politics, closing value of stock,
    and unemployment.

## Problem 2

### Import and clean data from Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
mr_tw = 
  read_excel("./data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         type = "Mr",
         homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) 
```

### Import and clean data from Professor Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
prof_tw =
  read_excel("./data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         type = "Professor",
         homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) 
```

### Import and clean data from Gwynnda Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
gw_tw =
  read_excel("./data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:K108") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         type = "Gwynnda",
         homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) 
```

### Merge datasets

``` r
trashwheel_tidy = 
  bind_rows(mr_tw, prof_tw, gw_tw) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(type, dumpster, everything()) %>% 
  arrange(type, dumpster)
```

### Description

1.  The number of observations in `mr_tw` dataset is 547. The key
    variables include `dumpster`, `weight_tons`, and `homes_powered`.
2.  The number of observations in `prof_tw` dataset is 94. The key
    variables include `dumpster`, `weight_tons`, and `homes_powered`.
3.  The number of observations in `gw_tw` dataset is 106. The key
    variables include `cigarette_butts`, `weight_tons`, and
    `homes_powered`.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 190.12

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021
is 1.63^{4}.

## Problem 3

### Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of baseline demographics

``` r
baseline = read.csv("./data/MCI_baseline.csv", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "male", "female"),
         apoe4 = ifelse(apoe4 == 1, "carrier", "non_carrier"),
         age_at_onset = as.numeric(age_at_onset))

baseline_mci = baseline %>%
  drop_na(age_at_onset)
```

Description:  
First import the csv data of baseline demographics and skip the first
row which is description.  
Use `janitor` to rename the variables, and use `mutate` function to
convert `sex` and `apoe4` into factor variables and convert
`age_at_onset` to numeric variable.  
Finally use `drop_na` function to remove the observations who do not
meet the stated inclusion criteria.  
There are 97 observations and 6 variables left in the dataset after
cleaning.

483 participants were recruited, and only 97 develop MCI.  
The average baseline age is 70.26, and the proportion of women in the
study are APOE4 carriers is 65.22%.

### Import, clean, and tidy the dataset of longitudinally observed biomarker values

``` r
amyloid = read.csv("./data/mci_amyloid.csv", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  rename(id = study_id) %>%
  mutate_all(as.numeric)
```

Description:  
First import the csv data of longitudinally observed biomarker values
and skip the first row which is description.  
Then, rename the variable `study_id` to `id` in order to prepare for
merging with the `baseline_mci` dataset.  
And use `mutate_all` function to convert all variables to numeric
variables.  
The dataset `amyloid` contains 6 variables and 487 observations. The key
variables include id, baseline, time_2, time_4, time_6, time_8.

### Check whether some participants appear in only the baseline or amyloid datasets

``` r
baseline_only = anti_join(baseline_mci, amyloid, by = "id") 
```

By checking, there are 3 participants appear in only the baseline
dataset, their `id` are `14`, `49`, and `268`. And there are 12
participants only appear in the amyloid dataset.

### Merge

``` r
baseline_amyloid_merge = inner_join(baseline_mci, amyloid, by = "id") %>%
  drop_na()
```

In order to only retain the participants who appear in both datasets, I
combined the two datasets by `id`.  
The resulting dataset contains 66 observations and 11 variables which
are id, current_age, sex, education, apoe4, age_at_onset, baseline,
time_2, time_4, time_6, time_8 after merging.

``` r
write.csv(baseline_amyloid_merge, "./data/result_merge.csv")
```
