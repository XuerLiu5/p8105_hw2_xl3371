## Problem 1

### First, clean the data in pols-month.csv

``` r
pols_month_clean = read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         day = as.integer(day)) %>%
  mutate(month = case_match(
    month, 
    "01" ~ "Jan",
    "02" ~ "Feb",
    "03" ~ "Mar",
    "04" ~ "Apr",
    "05" ~ "May",
    "06" ~ "Jun",
    "07" ~ "Jul",
    "08" ~ "Aug",
    "09" ~ "Sep",
    "10" ~ "Oct",
    "11" ~ "Nov",
    "12" ~ "Dec"
  )) %>%
  mutate(
    president = ifelse(prez_dem==1, "dem", "gop")) %>%
  select(-c(prez_gop, prez_dem, day))
```

### Second, clean the data in snp.csv

``` r
snp_clean = read.csv("./data/snp.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%y")) %>%
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         year = ifelse(year > 2049, year - 100, year),
    month = case_match(month, 
    "01" ~ "Jan",
    "02" ~ "Feb",
    "03" ~ "Mar",
    "04" ~ "Apr",
    "05" ~ "May",
    "06" ~ "Jun",
    "07" ~ "Jul",
    "08" ~ "Aug",
    "09" ~ "Sep",
    "10" ~ "Oct",
    "11" ~ "Nov",
    "12" ~ "Dec"
  )) %>%
  select(year, month, close) %>%
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  relocate(year, month)
```

### Third, tidy the unemployment data

``` r
unemployment_clean = read.csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "umemployment_rate"
  ) %>%
  rename(year = Year) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))
```

### Merge three datasets into result

``` r
pols_snp = left_join(pols_month_clean, snp_clean, by = c("year","month"))
result = left_join(pols_snp, unemployment_clean, by = c("year","month"))
```

### Description

1.  The `pols_month_clean` dataset contains 9 variables and 822
    observations. The key variables include year, month, and president
    (elected president’s party). This dataset tells us about the party
    affiliation distribution (democrat or republican) for governors and
    senators from years 1947 to 2015.
2.  The `snp_clean` dataset contains 3 variables and 787 observations,
    ranging from 1950 to 2015. The key variables include year, month,
    and close (closing values of stock index).
3.  The `unemployment_clean` dataset contains 3 variables and 816
    observations, ranging from 1948 to 2015. The key variables include
    year, month, and unemployment rate.
4.  The `result` dataset merges the above three datasets, with 11
    columns and 822 rows. The data ranges from 1947 to 2015, indicating
    the potential correlation between politics, closing value of stock,
    and unemployment.

## Problem 2

### Import and clean data from Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
mr_tw = 
  read_excel("./data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 1, range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         type = "Mr",
         homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) 
```

### Import and clean data from Professor Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
prof_tw =
  read_excel("./data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 2, range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         type = "Professor",
         homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) 
```

### Import and clean data from Gwynnda Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
gw_tw =
  read_excel("./data/202207 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = 4, range = "A2:K108") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(year = as.integer(year),
         type = "Gwynnda",
         homes_powered = (weight_tons * 500) / 30) 
```

### Combine

``` r
trashwheel_tidy = 
  bind_rows(mr_tw, prof_tw, gw_tw) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(type, dumpster, everything()) %>% 
  arrange(type, dumpster)
```

### Description

The number of observations in `mr_tw` dataset is 547. The key variables
include `dumpster`, `weight_tons`, and `homes_powered`. The number of
observations in `prof_tw` dataset is 94. The key variables include
`dumpster`, `weight_tons`, and `homes_powered`. The number of
observations in `gw_tw` dataset is 106. The key variables include
`cigarette_butts`, `weight_tons`, and `homes_powered`.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 190.12

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021
is 1.63^{4}.
